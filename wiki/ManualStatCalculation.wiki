#summary How to manually calculate statistics

= Introduction =

ZDStack isn't perfect, and one of its most common source of bugs is stat calculation.  In the event that realtime stats aren't saved, it is possible to re-generate them using a demo.  This wiki page describes that procedure for Windows.

= Install ZDStack =

You need to download Python, ZDStack, SQLAlchemy, and potentially Psycopg2 (see WindowsSupport for more information).  Installation of SQLAlchemy requires that you decompress the archive, open a `cmd` window to that new folder, and run `python setup.py install`.

Manually calculating statistics is a two-part process

== Generate Events ==

ZDStack uses the concept of "events" to represent very basic stats, and calculates more complicated, aggregate stats from them; examples are frags, flag touches, flag drops, etc.  These events must be timestamped, and we really prefer that the timestamp have a resolution of at least a millisecond (i.e. `2010-06-11 23:57:43.147` or `2010-06-11 23:57:43.147695` is microseconds).  This is why normal server logs are useless for ZDStack and stats generation; the resolution is limited only to seconds.  *35 events can occur in a second!!!!*
