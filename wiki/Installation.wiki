= Recommended Steps To Install ZDStack =

These steps will install ZDStack for a specific user only.  System-wide installation is not recommended, just as running ZDStack as root is not recommended.

  # Download ZDStack
  # Download and install the [http://code.google.com/p/zdstack/wiki/Requirements requirements]
  # `$ tar xjf ZDStack-*.tar.bz2`
  # `$ cd zdstack`
  # `$ python setup.py install --prefix=~/ZDStack`
  # Add `~/ZDStack/lib/python<pythonversion>/site-packages/ZDStack` to the PYTHONPATH environment variable ([http://code.google.com/p/zdstack/wiki/PythonPath instructions])
  # Install the ZDStack configuration file

= Installing the Example Configuration File =
  `zdstack` and `zservctl` will look in the following locations for a configuration file:
  * ./zdstackrc
  * ./zdstack.ini
  * ~/.zdstackrc
  * ~/.zdstack.ini
  * /etc/zdstackrc
  * /etc/zdstack.ini
  * /etc/zdstack/zdstackrc
  * /etc/zdstack/zdstack.ini

For system-wide installations (not recommended), the preferred location is `/etc/zdstack/zdstackrc`.  For user-local installations, the preferred location is `~/.zdstackrc`.
