#summary This is the list of features ZDStack is committed to, with current progress and status information.

|| Feature || Progress || What's the Hold Up? ||
|| Easy ProcessManagement (start | stop | restart), including automatic process restarting || 80% || Not tested at all ||
|| Simple ConfigurationFile for multiple processes || 90% || Not fully tested, especially for game-modes other than CTF. ||
|| Event processing, for PlayerStatistics and ServerResponse || 100% || Done! ||
|| ConnectionQualityStatistics || 0% || We get player IP addresses, but I haven't setup the "ping player, get results" framework yet.  That's a whole other Module in and of itself. ||
|| PlayerIdentity (IP-based) database || 100% || Done! ||
|| XML-RPC interface || 90% || The implementation is finished, but the zserv methods like start | stop | restart are un-tested.  Also, I'm not confident that the XML-RPC methods available will cover all use cases. ||
