#summary How to submit a bug report for ZDStack

It is tempting to log onto IRC and get me to help you with a problem.  I don't mind this, but frequently I need a lot more information.  To assist me, please do the following:

  * Run `zdstack debug` instead of `zdstack start`, which will generate a lot more debugging output (make sure you have adequate disk space).
  * Create an issue report [http://code.google.com/p/zdstack/issues/list here] and attach the resulting log file to it.
  * It is also quite helpful to have a config, so if you could strip out all passwords and sensitive information and attach that as well it is most helpful.

There are lots and lots of things that can go wrong in Doom, because the game is so modifiable.  So the more information I have about the context of the error or behavior you're seeing the better.
