#summary Managing ZDStack from the command-line

=Overview=
Managing ZDStack is fairly straight-forward, it is done with 2 programs, `zdstackctl` and `zservctl`.

=zdstackctl=

`zdstackctl` manages the ZDStack process as a whole.  You can start/stop/restart ZDStack using this.

{{{
Usage: zdstackctl [ start | stop | restart ] -c [ config_file ]
}}}
Use of `-c` is optional; `zdstackctl` actually looks in lots of standard places for a configuration file, so most of the time you won't have to specify this.

=zservctl=

`zservctl` manages individual ZServ instances.  Here's the usage information:

{{{
Usage:
    zservctl start -n [ zserv_name ] -c [ config_file ]
    zservctl stop -n [ zserv_name ] -c [ config_file ]
    zservctl restart -n [ zserv_name ] -c [ config_file ]
    zservctl start-all -c [ config_file ]
    zservctl stop-all -c [ config_file ]
    zservctl restart-all -c [ config_file ]
    zservctl reload-config -c [ config_file ]
}}}

It's important to note that `zservctl reload-config` must be run after making changes to the configuration files, otherwise the changes won't be recognized.
