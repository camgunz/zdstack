#summary Managing a zserv process with ZDStack.

Managing a zserv process with ZDStack is pretty straight-forward.  The only thing you need to remember is that the process you want to manage must have an entry in zdstack.ini.  For example:
{{{
[D5M1]
type: duel
wads: dwango5.wad,zvox2.wad
timelimit: 0
port: 10666
advertise: 1
maps: map01
}}}
To start this server, use the `zdstackctl` program.  Here's the usage information:
{{{
Usage: zdstackctl [ start | stop | restart | start_zserv [ -n name ] |
											 stop_zserv [ -n name ] |
											 restart_zserv [ -n name ] |
                    start_all | stop_all | restart_all ] [ -c configfile ]
}}}
Use of `-c` is optional, but `-n` is required.  In this case, the command-line would be:
{{{
zdstackctl start -n D5M1
}}}
`stop` and `restart` work the same way.
