#summary Managing a zserv process with ZDStack.

Managing a zserv process with ZDStack is pretty straight-forward.  The only thing you need to remember is that the process you want to manage must have an entry in zdstack.ini.  For example:
{{{
[D5M1]
type: 1-on-1
wads: dwango5.wad,zvox2.wad
timelimit: 0
port: 10666
advertise: 1
maps: map01
}}}
To start this server, use the `zdstackctl` program.  Here's the usage information:
{{{
Usage: zdstackctl [ start | stop | restart | start_all | stop_all | restart_all ]
                  [ -c configfile ] [ -n name ]
}}}
Use of `-c` is optional, but `-n` is required.  In this case, the command-line would be:
{{{
zdstackctl start -n D5M1
}}}
`stop` and `restart` work the same way.

A common mistake is to change the name of the server and try to restart it.  That will not work (although it may be fixed later) because the configuration section for the running server won't be found (because you renamed it).  The server must be stopped, the name changed, and the configuration started again.  A workaround is to:

  # Copy a configuration section, changing the name
  # Stop the old server
  # Restart the new server
