#summary ZDStack Requirements.
#labels Featured,Phase-Requirements

= Supported Platforms =

ZDStack has been developed, tested, and used on 32-bit Linux (CentOS 5, Ubuntu 7.10 and 8.04).  It should work on any POSIX platform (Mac OS X, BSD, 64-bit varieties thereof) and bug reports to the contrary are welcome.  Windows will probably never work, and is unsupported.

= Required Packages =

ZDStack requires:

  * zserv ([http://www.zdaemon.org])
    * In order to run fully, a file called an IWAD is needed.  IWADs are contained in commercial versions of DooM (The Ultimate DooM, Plutonia, TNT, Final DooM, etc.), and the awesome Freedoom ([http://freedoom.sourceforge.net]) is a great alternative, although you'll be missing out on the intense battles of doom2map01.
  * Python 2.5 or greater ([http://www.python.org])
  * pyfileutils 0.8.4 or greater ([http://pyfileutils.googlecode.com])
  * SQLAlchemy 0.5 or greater ([http://www.sqlalchemy.org])
  * Elixir 0.6 or greater ([http://elixir.ematia.de])

= Optional Features and Their Requirements =

  * Using JSON-RPC requires either Python 2.6.X, or the `simplejson` package ([http://code.google.com/p/simplejson/]).  The easiest way to obtain simplejson is to run `easy_install simplejson` at the command-prompt.   If you don't have the `easy_install` utility, visit the [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall EasyInstall] webpage and follow the instructions there.
