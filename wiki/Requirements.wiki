#summary ZDStack Requirements.
#labels Featured,Phase-Requirements

= Supported Platforms =

ZDStack has been developed, tested, and used on 32-bit Linux (CentOS 5, Ubuntu 7.10 and 8.04).  It should work on any POSIX platform (Mac OS X, BSD, 64-bit varieties thereof) and bug reports to the contrary are welcome.  Windows will probably never work, and is unsupported.

= Basic Requirements =

In order to run, ZDStack requires the following:

  * zserv ([http://www.zdaemon.org])
    * zserv requires a file called an IWAD.  IWADs are contained in commercial versions of DooM (The Ultimate DooM, Plutonia, TNT, Final DooM, etc.).  The awesome Freedoom ([http://freedoom.sourceforge.net]) is a great alternative, although you'll be missing out on the intense battles of doom2map01.
  * Python 2.5 or greater ([http://www.python.org])
  * pyfileutils 0.8.4 or greater ([http://pyfileutils.googlecode.com])
  * SQLAlchemy 0.5 or greater ([http://www.sqlalchemy.org])
  * Elixir 0.6 or greater ([http://elixir.ematia.de])

The following features are available using only the above packages:

  * zserv process management (start | stop | restart)
  * Automatic zserv restarting in the event of a crash
  * Simple configuration for multiple zserv servers
  * Event processing and real-time statistics generation
  * Player => IP logging
  * An RPC interface using XML as a transport

= Optional Features and Their Requirements =

== JSON-RPC ==

Using JSON-RPC requires one of the following:

  * Python 2.6 (or greater)
  * The simplejson package ([http://code.google.com/p/simplejson/]).

If you don't have Python 2.6, installing simplejson is... simple: run `easy_install simplejson` at the command-prompt.   If you don't have the `easy_install` utility, visit the [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall EasyInstall] webpage and follow the instructions there.

== Detached Database ==

By default, ZDStack uses the SQLite ([http://www.sqlite.org]) database engine.  However, SQLite cannot be accessed over a network (including the Internet), and furthermore cannot reliably be accessed by more than one process at a time without complicated locking mechanisms.  ZDStack supports the use of many database engines, but they each require third-party software packages -- many of which are C modules that require compilation.
