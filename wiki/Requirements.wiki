#summary ZDStack Requirements.
#labels Featured,Phase-Requirements

= Supported Platforms =

ZDStack has been developed, tested, and used on 32-bit Linux (CentOS 5).  It should work on any POSIX platform (Mac OS X, BSD, 64-bit varieties thereof) and bug reports to the contrary are welcome.  Windows will probably never work, and is unsupported.

= Required Packages =

ZDStack requires:

  * zserv ([http://www.zdaemon.org])
    * In order to run fully, a file called an IWAD is needed.  IWADs are contained in commercial versions of DooM (The Ultimate DooM, Plutonia, TNT, Final DooM, etc.), and the awesome Freedoom ([http://freedoom.sourceforge.net]) is a great alternative, although you'll be missing out on the intense battles of doom2map01.
  * Python 2.4 or greater ([http://www.python.org])
  * pyfileutils 0.7 or greater ([http://pyfileutils.googlecode.com])
    * pyfileutils 0.8 and up requires Python 2.5

Should you decide to use Player => IP mapping, you will need:

  * Python 2.5 or greater ([http://www.python.org])
  * PyXSE 0.4 or greater ([http://pyxse.googlecode.com])
  * pyfileutils 0.8.2 or greater ([http://pyfileutils.googlecode.com])
