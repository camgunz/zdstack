#summary ZDStack Requirements.
#labels Featured,Phase-Requirements

= Supported Platforms =

ZDStack has been developed, tested, and used on 32-bit Linux (CentOS 5, Ubuntu 7.10 and 8.04).  It should work on any POSIX platform (Mac OS X, BSD, 64-bit varieties thereof) and bug reports to the contrary are welcome.  Windows will probably never work, and is unsupported.

= Required Packages =

ZDStack requires:

  * zserv ([http://www.zdaemon.org])
    * In order to run fully, a file called an IWAD is needed.  IWADs are contained in commercial versions of DooM (The Ultimate DooM, Plutonia, TNT, Final DooM, etc.), and the awesome Freedoom ([http://freedoom.sourceforge.net]) is a great alternative, although you'll be missing out on the intense battles of doom2map01.
  * Python 2.5 or greater ([http://www.python.org])
  * pyfileutils 0.7 or greater ([http://pyfileutils.googlecode.com])
    * pyfileutils 0.8 and up requires Python 2.5

Should you decide to use Player => IP mapping, you will need:

  * PyXSE 0.4 or greater ([http://pyxse.googlecode.com])
  * pyfileutils 0.8.2 or greater ([http://pyfileutils.googlecode.com])

ZDStack offers the option to use either JSON or XML as the RPC transport format.  Using XML requires no extra libraries, XML parsing is built into the Python standard library.  Using JSON, however, requires the `simplejson` package.  The easiest way to obtain simplejson is to run `easy_install simplejson` at the command-prompt.   If you don't have the `easy_install` utility, visit the [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall EasyInstall] webpage and follow the instructions there.
