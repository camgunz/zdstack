#summary Changelog for 0.11

= Features =

  * Stats are now saved in a database (see DatabaseConfiguration).
  * Events/Stats/Plugins can now reliably be disabled.
  * `add_mapnum_to_hostname` works.
  * `zserv` logfiles are no longer required, and no longer generated by default (they can be configured to generate however, using `save_logfile`).
  * The address ZDStack listens on for RPC commands can be explicitly configured now.
  * RPC methods now require authentication -- ones that do anything anyway.
  * Log folder and PID file can now explicitly be specified.
  * JSON-RPC now works interchangeably with XML-RPC.
  * Added the ZDSWeb administration interface.
  * Added support for 1.08.08 log files (containing timestamped events).
  * Support for 'zserv crashing too fast' -- such `zserv` processes are now not automatically restarted.
  * Duplicate ports are detected in the configuration file.
  * Required folders are created when possible.
  * JSON-RPC now supports either `simplejson` or python 2.6's `json` module, rather than just requiring `simplejson`.
  * Much more state is now saved in events, such as whether players were holding flags, team scores, etc.
  * Limited RCON is now supported.
  * `zdrpc` an now either print the zserv's response as lines from the log, or as event data dicts.
  * The python documentation files are now generated using sphinx, which is a big improvement over the ugliness that was pydoc
  * `pyfileutils` is no longer a requirement
  * When saving a configuration using RPC methods, section order is preserved, and options are sorted alphabetically

= Fixes =

The following problems/issues/bugs were fixed.

  * If an option was defined in the `DEFAULT` section, as a game_mode default, and in the server's own configuration section, the game_mode default would take precedent.
  * Only some options were supported as game_mode defaults.  Now the logic is applied to all server-specific options.
  * Random problems while dealing with a running ZDStack process were fixed (including changing the configuration file, starting/stopping/removing/adding servers, etc.).
  * `reload-config` was a `zservctl` action... which didn't make any sense.
  * Impossible to change the game mode of a server.
  * If errors were present in the configuration and it was reloaded, the current configuration could be overwritten with bad values.
  * getting/setting zserv configs did not work.
  * RAM and CPU usage drastically reduced.
  * Threading was crazy out of control in 0.10.  Most things are now centralized in the main ZDStack thread, preventing lots of threading bugs (like CPU spinning, etc.)
  * There were many race conditions and non-threadsafe areas of the code, most (if not all) of which have been resolved.
