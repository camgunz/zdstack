#summary Individual player statistics.

One of the things that ZDaemon is really missing is statistics.  zserv keeps logs, but the level of detail isn't quite on the level as modern FPS's, i.e., zserv is missing:

  * Shots taken & Shots landed
    * Shot accuracy, Shot fatality rate
  * Item pickup
    * Item whoring, Weapon preference

zserv does log:

  * Frags/Deaths (fragger, fraggee, weapon)
  * Flags (touched, lost, scored, dropped, returned)
  * Connections (player name, player IP)
  * Messages (messager, message)
  * Team joins/switches
  * Map switches

Since a log watcher can keep track of when it receives those log messages, we can add rates and durations to our stats, giving us:

  * Time between flag touch and flag loss/cap
    * Flag-runner evasion, Flag-runner speed
  * Time between frags
    * Frag rate
  * Time between deaths
    * Death rate

We also know player clans and colors, so we can bundle player stats into clan and team (color) stats.  Because zserv logs team switches, we can ensure that team stats aren't ruined by team switchers.
