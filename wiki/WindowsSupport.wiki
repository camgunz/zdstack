#summary Running ZDStack on Windows

= Overview =

While ZDStack itself will probably never run on Windows (for mainly philosophical reasons as well as limited developer resources), it can still be used as a library.

=== Where to get requirements to run ZDStack on Windows ===

Most Windows users don't have a compiler installed, but some of ZDStack's requirements have C source code components.  For JSON support, Windows users should just use Python 2.6 or higher (again, not Python 3.0 or higher).  This is a list of locations for binary versions of those requirements, otherwise the normal source distributions will work just fine.  So far this is just Psycopg2 for PostgreSQL support - although I'm sure there are Windows binaries for MySQL and other databases (SQLite support is built into Python, so this isn't a strict requirement).

=== What has to be changed to run on Windows ===

ZDStack needs logic to not create/use FIFOs and to track log rolls.
