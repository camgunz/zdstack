#summary Todo list for the current release of ZDStack

  
  * Write some standard plugins for inclusion
    * ~~unique players only~~
    * ~~clean language~~
    * ~~robust anti-teamkill~~
    * ~~map/kick/reset voting~~
    * ~~fair teams~~
      * ~~Can't join the winning team unless they're down a player~~
      * ~~Can't join a team when it would put them up 2 players~~
    * anti-teamswitch
      * If a player has switched to the winning team more than once, and (switches - 1) have occurred within 30 seconds of a flag score, kick that player.

  * Test plugins on TT-beta
  * Disallow duplicate ports in server config sections
  * Detect rapid server crashing: stop the server and log an error
  * Figure out how to make ban-list management easier ([http://code.google.com/p/zdstack/wiki/ZDSWeb ZDSWeb] interface?)
