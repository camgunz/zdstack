#summary Todo list for the current release of ZDStack

  
  * Write some standard plugins for inclusion
    * ~~unique players only~~
    * ~~clean language~~
    * ~~robust anti-teamkill~~
    * ~~map/kick/reset voting~~
    * ~~fair teams~~
      * ~~Can't join the winning team unless they're down a player~~
      * ~~Can't join a team when it would put them up 2 players~~
    * anti-teamswitch
      * If a player has switched to the winning team more than once, and (switches - 1) have occurred within 30 seconds of a flag score, kick that player.
  * Test plugins (again, because everything's different now)
  * ~~Disallow duplicate ports in server config sections~~
  * ~~Detect rapid server crashing: stop the server and log an error~~
  * Figure out how to make ban-list management easier ([http://code.google.com/p/zdstack/wiki/ZDSWeb ZDSWeb] interface?)
  * ~~Keep configuration sections sorted~~
  * ~~Make non-debugging output even quieter (no 'Spawning zserv' messages)~~
  * ~~Should auto-create more folders (if possible):~~
    * ~~zdstack_log_folder~~
    * ~~zdstack_zserv_folder~~
    * ~~zdstack_plugin_folder~~
  * ~~Implement zserv logfile saving~~
  * Duplicate ports are still allowed - fix
