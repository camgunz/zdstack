#summary Immediate To-Do list for ZDStack

  * Fix Issue 12

  * Fix Issue 15

  * Fix Issue 18

  * Test alternate game modes w/ !NoStar (Coop, Duel, FFA, TeamDM)

  * Test all the server config variables like removebotswhenhumans, etc.

  * There are a lot of "CTF-Only" stats, like flag_returns, etc.  Maybe a player should
  know what kind of server he's in, and hold his stats accordingly.  We could:
    * Break stats out into CTFStatKeeper, TeamDMStatKeeper, FFAStatKeeper, 
    !CoopStatKeeper and !DuelStatKeeper
    * Break players out into CTFPlayer, TeamDMPlayer, FFAPlayer, !CoopPlayer and
    !DuelPlayer, and rename Player to !BasePlayer
    * Move all instantiation to classes that have ZServ references, like !LogListener or
    ZServ itself.
