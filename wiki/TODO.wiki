#summary Immediate To-Do list for ZDStack

  * Fix Issue 12

  * Fix Issue 15

  * Test all the server config variables like removebotswhenhumans, etc.

  * Class/Function/Member documentation is almost non-existent.  Although this
    will probably push us over 3k LOC, it's worth it if we're going to
	implement the plugin system detailed in ServerResponse, so we can generate
	pydocs for all the code.
