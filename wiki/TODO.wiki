#summary Todo list for the current release of ZDStack

  * ~~Test new frag representation.~~

  * ~~Generate !PyDoc stuff for plugin authors.~~

  * ~~Augment setup.py to install the sample config file in the proper location (i.e., if root install in /etc/zdstack, otherwise install in ~/.zdstack).~~

  * ~~Add a README file, and an INSTALL file.~~

  * ~~Add base_url option to zdwebstatsrc and make sure the URL structuring of ZDWebStats works OK (i.e., at the root and at an arbitrary relative location).~~

  * ~~Fix ugly server info stuff in ZDWebStats.  Probably make it so that $SERVER_URL/$SERVER/ displays server info, and $SERVER_URL/$SERVER/$MAP_NUM/ displays what we're used to... necessitating changes in the main page as well (server name goes to server info, map name goes to map stats).~~

  * Test all the server response methods.

  * Test on-the-fly config modification.
