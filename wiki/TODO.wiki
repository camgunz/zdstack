#summary Todo list for the current release of ZDStack

  * ~~Test new frag representation... there's still a little more work to do on this.~~

  * Test all the server response methods.

  * Generate !PyDoc stuff for plugin authors.

  * Make sure the URL structuring of ZDWebStats works OK (i.e., at the root and at an arbitrary relative location).

  * Fix ugly server info stuff in ZDWebStats.  Probably make it so that $SERVER_URL/$SERVER/ displays server info, and $SERVER_URL/$SERVER/$MAP_NUM/ displays what we're used to... necessitating changes in the main page as well (server name goes to server info, map name goes to map stats).

  * Test on-the-fly config modification.

  * Augment setup.py to install the sample config file in the proper location (i.e., if root install in /etc/zdstack, otherwise install in ~/.zdstack).

  * Augment setup.py to install the PyDocs in $PREFIX/share/doc/ZDStack.

  * Add a README file, and an INSTALL file.
