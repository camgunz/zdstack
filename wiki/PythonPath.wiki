=Environment Variables=

POSIX operating systems like BSD, Mac OS X and Linux have a concept called *Environment Variables*, which basically store information so that the programs you run can retrieve it later.  Some examples include DOOMWADDIR, which some DooM source ports use to search for WAD files.

=Using and Setting Environment Variables=

Different shells have different ways of doing this, however, the two main styles are BASH and CSH.

BASH Style: `export PYTHONPATH=~/ZDStack/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ZDStack`
CSH Style: `setenv PYTHONPATH ~/ZDStack/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ZDStack`

TCSH uses the same style as CSH.

=Saving Environment Variables=

When you log out, your environment is reset, so any variables you may have set are lost.  You can automate the setting of environment variables by saving the commands in an "rc" file, however, this file is also different depending upon which shell you are using.

BASH rc file: ~/.bashrc
CSH rc file: ~/.cshrc
TCSH rc file: ~/.tcshrc
