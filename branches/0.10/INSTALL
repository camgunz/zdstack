=== INSTALLATION ===
System-wide installation is not recommended, just as running ZDStack as root is
not recommended.

   1. Download ZDStack
   2. Download and install the requirements
   3. $ tar xjf ZDStack-*.tar.bz2
   4. $ cd zdstack
   5. $ python setup.py install --prefix=~/ZDStack
   6. Add ~/ZDStack/lib/python<pythonversion>/site-packages/ZDStack to the
      PYTHONPATH environment variable (instructions)
   7. Install the ZDStack configuration file 

zdstackctl and zservctl will look in the following locations for a configuration
file: 

     * ./zdstackrc
     * ./zdstack.ini
     * ~/.zdstackrc
     * ~/.zdstack.ini
     * /etc/zdstackrc
     * /etc/zdstack.ini
     * /etc/zdstack/zdstackrc
     * /etc/zdstack/zdstack.ini 

For system-wide installations (not recommended), the preferred location is
/etc/zdstack/zdstackrc. For user-local installations, the preferred location is
~/.zdstackrc.
