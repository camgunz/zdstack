- There used to be an issue where if a player joins a team ('Ladna joined the
  game on the Red team') before ZDStack can sync its internal list of players,
  event handling (and thus statistics and plugins) can be hopelessly messed up.
  At the time it was recommended that events, statistics and plugins be
  disabled, however, the issue should be resolved at this point.  Test away!
