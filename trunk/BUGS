- If a player joins a team ('Ladna joined the game on the Red team') before
  ZDStack can sync its internal list of players, event handling (and thus
  statistics and plugins) can be hopelessly messed up.  It is recommended
  that events, statistics and plugins be disabled for the time being.  This
  issue will be resolved before 0.11 proper is released.
