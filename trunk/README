=== Introduction ===

This is the README file for ZDStack.  ZDStack is released under the MIT license,
specific details are in the LICENSE file contained in this distribution.
Alternately, the license can be found at
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php, although, if the LICENSE
file is not included, the distributor has violated the license.

=== Overview ===

ZDStack manages multiple zserv processes.  Normally, zserv does not fork to the
background, which makes running multiple zserv processes cumbersome.  The
traditional solution is to use GNU Screen or to write a quick wrapper script.
However, these solutions require you to login to the server if you want to
manage the processes in any way.  ZDStack resolves this, making zserv
management much easier, while providing other useful features.

=== What ZDStack Actually Is ===

Technically, ZDStack is an RPC server (either XML-RPC or JSON-RPC).  It spawns
zserv processes as subprocesses and listens to their log output for events (like
frags, deaths, flag captures, etc.)  ZDStack can be controlled over its RPC
interface and even return information like current map name/number, and the
number of players currently connected to each ZServ.

ZDStack also maintains a database of game information, which includes:

  * Statistics (frags/deaths/flag touches, etc.)
  * Player aliases

=== Documentation/Usage ===

ZDStack is fairly well documented in its Wiki at http://zdstack.googlecode.com.

=== Contact ===

I can be contacted using my GMail address (available at the above website) or
sometimes on IRC at irc.oftc.net in #idl (nick: Ladna).  I'd prefer, if bugs
or other issues are discovered, that the Google Code issue page be used.  Odds
are I'll forget things if someone just PMs or e-mails me.  I'm always happy to
help users though, just let me know if you have a problem.
