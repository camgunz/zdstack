=== Introduction ===

This is the README file for ZDStack.  ZDStack is released under the MIT license,
specific details are in the LICENSE file contained in this distribution.
Alternately, the license can be found at http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php, although, if the LICENSE file is not included, the distributor has
violated the license.

=== Overview ===

ZDStack manages multiple zserv processes.  Normally, zserv does not fork to the background, which makes running multiple zserv processes cumbersome.  The
traditional solution is to use GNU Screen or to write a quick wrapper script.
However, these solutions require you to login to the server if you want to
manage the processes in any way.  ZDStack resolves this, making zserv
management much easier, while providing other useful features.

=== What ZDStack Actually Is ===

Technically, ZDStack is an RPC server (either XML-RPC or JSON-RPC).  It spawns
zserv processes as subprocesses and listens to their log output for events (like
frags, deaths, flag captures, etc.)  ZDStack can be queried over its RPC
interface and return information like:

  * Frags/Deaths/Flag Captures... and game stats in general
  * Server information, like uptime, gravity, air control, maplist, etc.

You can also use this RPC interface to control a zserv process.  You can send
console messages, change maps, kick/ban players, anything you could normally do
from a console.  However, the RPC interface can be used from any machine, and
it's even possible to create a GUI or web app that controls zserv processes via
that interface.

ZDStack also maintains a database of player names to IP addresses.  For
administrative reasons, it's important to know who is playing on your servers,
even if those players are using aliases.  The Player=>IP database allows just
that.

=== Documentation/Usage ===

ZDStack is fairly well documented in its Wiki at http://zdstack.googlecode.com.

=== Contact ===

I can be contacted using my GMail address (available at the above website) or
sometimes on IRC at irc.oftc.net in #IDL (nick: Ladna).  I'd prefer, if bugs
or other issues are discovered, that the Google Code issue page be used.  Odds
are I'll forget things if someone just PMs or e-mails me.  I'm always happy to
help users though, just let me know if you have a problem.
