  - Figure out banlist management
    - Ban
      - User/Users
      - Specific server/All servers
      - With/Without timelimit
    - Unban
      - User/Users
      - Specific server/All servers
    - Whitelist (doesn't skip ZD master ban)
      - User/Users
      - Specific server/All servers
  - Test/Rewrite plugins
  - Add Indexes to ZDSModels
  - Add a "send RPC command" function to ZDSWeb
  - Setup firebird so it's not pigeonholed as an embedded DB

  - Figure something out regarding cvar_overrides
  - For global options that use cvar_overrides (overtime, add_mapnum), detect
    changes to maps that are not in the maplist, and manually set those
    cvar_overrides when the round loads
  - Detect set_command events, and modify the ZServ's instance variables (and
    config options) accordingly
  - Maybe implement some kind of config file logic that strips '_' characters
    out of option names; trying to remember it for every option is aggravating
  - Skulltag & Odamex support (investigate at least)
