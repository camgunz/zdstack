TODO:

    Write a Dictable.get_stats() function.  Maybe I can just re-appropriate
      'get_dict()' in BaseStatKeeper.

    Add Player => IP logging to Player upon initialization.  This requires the
      persistence backend (and possible abstraction layer?).

    Add Player latency and packet-loss tracking.  This requires the ping spawning
      and parsing backend.

    Add message responses.  Haven't completely figured out how to do this yet,
      keep thinking on it.

    Keep a pipe open to and from running zserv processes in ZServ, create
      appropriate methods in ZServ to read from/send to pipes.

    Normalize game-mode-specific stuff in ZServ's config section.  See source
      for details

    Create separate ZServ classes for different game modes, thereby spreading
      out some of the configuration mess, and maybe making for cooler
      customization.

    Fix the types in ZServ's config section.

    Figure out how to not remember a map if no one joined the game during it.

    Fix the mess that is __init__, I don't even know what's going on in there.

    Bring zdstackctl up to date.

    Bring zdstack.ini-example up to date.

    Re-add forking, logging, etc. to Server (WTF, where did it go?!).
