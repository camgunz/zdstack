  - Setting the IP for zserv advertising doesn't change the 'zds://' links in
    ZDSWeb
  - You can probably add some sections when you Set Config in ZDSWeb, Stack
    should check for this
  - Figure out banlist management
    - Add a "send RPC command" function to ZDSWeb
  - Setup firebird so it's not pigeonholed as an embedded DB
  - Debug with multiple players, and then multiple servers and multiple players

  - Figure something out regarding cvar_overrides
  - For global options that use cvar_overrides (overtime, add_mapnum), detect
    changes to maps that are not in the maplist, and manually set those
    cvar_overrides when the round loads
  - Detect set_command events, and modify the ZServ's instance variables (and
    config options) accordingly
  - Maybe implement some kind of config file logic that strips '_' characters
    out of option names; trying to remember it for every option is aggravating
