TODO:

    Add auto-respawn to configuration.

    Add Player latency and packet-loss tracking.  This requires the ping
      spawning and parsing backend.

    Add message responses.  Haven't completely figured out how to do this yet,
      keep thinking on it.

    At some point, expand the authentication scheme so that permissions are
      a little more fine-grained.  As in, it would be nice to give out
      the ability to restart servers and boot players... but not change the
      configuration... and vice versa.
