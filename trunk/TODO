TODO:

    Test all the server config variables like removebotswhenhumans, etc. 

    Add Player latency and packet-loss tracking.  This requires the ping
      spawning and parsing backend.

    Add message responses.  Haven't completely decided on the implementation,
      but I'm coming around to it.

    At some point, expand the authentication scheme so that permissions are
      a little more fine-grained.  As in, it would be nice to give out
      the ability to restart servers and boot players... but not change the
      configuration... and vice versa.
