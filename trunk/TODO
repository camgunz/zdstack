TODO:

    At some point, expand the authentication scheme so that permissions are
      a little more fine-grained.  As in, it would be nice to give out
      the ability to restart servers and boot players... but not change the
      configuration... and vice versa.

    Figure out how to not remember a map if no one joined the game during it.

    Write a Dictable.get_stats() function.  Maybe I can just re-appropriate
      'get_dict()' in BaseStatKeeper.

    Add Player => IP logging to Player upon initialization.  This requires the
      persistence backend (and possible abstraction layer?).

    Add Player latency and packet-loss tracking.  This requires the ping
      spawning and parsing backend.

    Add message responses.  Haven't completely figured out how to do this yet,
      keep thinking on it.
